# Temperature-Converter
"I developed a temperature converter tool that allows users to easily convert between different temperature scales, including Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the tool features a user-friendly interface that instantly updates the converted values as users input temperatures."
